Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers together to find their **sum**. When we add numbers, we are essentially counting how many objects we have in total.

For example, if you have 2 apples and someone gives you 3 more apples, you would use addition to find out that you now have 5 apples in total: 2 + 3 = 5.

The plus sign (**+**) is used to show addition. The numbers being added are called **addends**.

Subtraction is taking away one number from another to find the **difference**. When we subtract, we are finding out how many are left after removing some objects.

For example, if you have 5 oranges and you eat 2 of them, you would use subtraction to find out that you have 3 oranges left: 5 - 2 = 3.

The minus sign (**-**) is used to show subtraction. The number being subtracted is called the **subtrahend**, the number you're subtracting from is called the **minuend**.

Multiplication is like repeated addition. It's a quick way to add the same number multiple times.

For example, 3 x 4 means adding 3 four times (3 + 3 + 3 + 3) or adding 4 three times (4 + 4 + 4). Both equal 12.

The numbers being multiplied are called **factors**, and the result is called the **product**. The symbol 'x' or sometimes '*' is used.

Division is splitting a number into equal groups. It's the opposite of multiplication.

For example, 12 Ã· 4 asks how many groups of 4 are in 12. The answer is 3.

The number being divided is the **dividend**, the number dividing it is the **divisor**, and the result is the **quotient**. The symbol 'Ã·' or '/' is used.

Plants are living organisms belonging to the kingdom Plantae. They are essential for life on Earth.

Most plants perform **photosynthesis**, using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create their own food (sugar) and release oxygen.

Key parts often include roots (absorb water/nutrients), stems (support), leaves (photosynthesis), flowers (reproduction), and fruits (contain seeds).

Animals exhibit diverse forms, habitats, and behaviors. They are broadly classified into vertebrates (with backbones) and invertebrates (without backbones).

Major groups include mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, insects, mollusks, and more.

Weather refers to the state of the atmosphere at a particular place and time, including temperature, humidity, precipitation (rain, snow), wind, and cloud cover.

It is driven by differences in air pressure, temperature, and moisture, often influenced by the sun's energy.

Meteorologists study weather patterns to make forecasts. Common weather phenomena include rain, sunshine, storms, fog, and wind.

Grammar is the set of rules governing how words are combined to form sentences in a language.

Key components include parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.), sentence structure (subject, predicate), punctuation (periods, commas), and tense (past, present, future).

Understanding grammar helps us communicate clearly and effectively in writing and speaking.
