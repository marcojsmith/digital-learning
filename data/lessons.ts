      <p>Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers together to find their <strong>sum</strong>. When we add numbers, we are essentially counting how many objects we have in total.</p>
      <p>For example, if you have 2 apples and someone gives you 3 more apples, you would use addition to find out that you now have 5 apples in total: 2 + 3 = 5.</p>
